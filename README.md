# 🛠️ Detailed Design API Example

A skeleton project demonstrating a detailed design for a simple backend API. Includes directory structure and wire-framed modules (controllers, routes, utils, helpers, config, etc.), but **no business logic implementations**.

## 💡 Why Use Detailed Design?

- **Risk Reduction Early:** Surfaces architectural, data, and integration risks before code is written, allowing teams to mitigate them while changes are still inexpensive.
- **Alignment on Patterns & Standards:** Ensures consistent design patterns, naming conventions, database schemas, and API structures, preventing rework from misaligned approaches.
- **Improved Estimate Accuracy:** Well-defined components and interfaces make effort and timeline estimates more reliable.
- **Clear Developer Guidance:** Acts as a blueprint, reducing ambiguity in how components, services, and data flows interact.
- **Easier Review & Feedback Loops:** Stakeholders can review and give feedback on the design before coding starts, ensuring business needs, performance expectations, and edge cases are accounted for.
- **Better Integration Planning:** Clarifies dependencies, data transformations, and required API contracts early for multi-domain or multi-service systems.
