# detailed-design-api-example
Used as a example of a "detailed design" for a simple backend api: essentially a skeleton project with directory structure, wireâ€‘framed modules (controllers, routes, utils, helpers, config, etc.), but without any actual business logic implementations.



Example

Schema Definition > Resolver defined > repository > define queries > Define any helpers or utilities during this process
